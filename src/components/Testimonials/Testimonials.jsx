      review: `I met sanjiv sir regarding the treatment of my grandmother age 78 years as she has fractures in her lower spinal cord and has severe pain. Sir refused surgery becoz of age instead treated her through medicines and she has immense relief within 5 months of treatment and she is back to her normal regular routine. We really thankful to you sir.

      review: `My experience is really great. My age is 68 and i was suffered with severe pain in back and right leg due to disc bulge. I was not able to walk properly. I tried physiotherapy for almost one month without any benefit. After consulting with Dr. Asati, I agreed for Surgery and from next day of surgery, thier is no pain in my leg and able to walk. Today after one month I m in state of normal life without pain. üòä

      I m thankful to Dr Sanjeev Asati for this. üôè`,
